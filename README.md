# Immich Places

Immich Places is an add-on web UI for existing Immich instances that helps you assign GPS coordinates to photos that are missing location data.

![Immich Places](.github/readme/screen-map.jpeg)

The app has two parts:

- Frontend: Next.js app (served on port `3032`) for map review, bulk selection, and location assignment.
- Backend: Go service that syncs metadata from Immich, stores local state in SQLite, and performs geocode/sync jobs.

## Why it exists

- Fix geolocation for older photos with missing GPS.
- Keep existing Immich users and albums in sync while you enrich missing coordinates.
- Run the workflow from a fast map + list interface instead of manual per-item workflows.

## Features

**Map & Location**

- Interactive map with clustered markers (Leaflet)
- Drag-and-drop a photo onto the map to assign coordinates
- Geocoding search with autocomplete and history (Nominatim by default, optional HERE and Google Maps providers)
- Favorite places: star locations from search results for quick access
- Smart suggestions: locations from nearby-in-time photos, same-day, nearby-day, weekly patterns, frequent spots, and album context
- GPX import: upload one or multiple GPX tracks to batch-assign coordinates to photos by timestamp

**Photo Browsing**

- Photo grid with configurable columns and page size
- Filter by GPS status (missing / present / all) and by album
- Go to location: jump to a photo's position on the map from the grid
- Fullscreen lightbox with keyboard navigation
- Multi-select with shift+click for bulk operations

**Sync & Data**

- Background sync keeps assets up to date with Immich (configurable interval)
- Manual sync trigger from the UI
- Local SQLite database — no changes to Immich until you explicitly save
- Confirmation bar to review and save/cancel pending coordinate changes

**AI analysis and review**

- Optional [private provider settings](docs/ai-provider-settings.md), disabled by default: encrypted credentials, revisioned edits and profile enable/disable.
- Saving settings makes no provider request. Explicit capability tests and production execution use the configured destination and resource policies.
- [Batch analysis](docs/ai-batch-workflow.md) previews exact assets, records mode-specific consent and provides durable progress, cancellation and explicit reruns.
- [Persistent results](docs/ai-results-history.md) retain private run history independently of current GPS; [proposal inspection](docs/ai-proposal-review.md) shows separate camera/subject locations, uncertainty, evidence and requested-language descriptions.
- AI review is read-only. Draft editing and confirmed Immich writeback remain planned.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Immich instance already running (local or remote).
- Docker and `docker compose` on the target host.
- A valid Immich API key for the user who will configure Immich Places.
- Access to a shell on the Immich Places host.

## 1) Copy env values

From this repo root, create `.env` with the values below:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:

- `IMMICH_URL`: Base URL used by the backend to call your Immich API.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`: Random key used to encrypt stored Immich API keys in the local DB.
- `TRUST_PROXY_TLS`: Set to `true` when behind HTTPS reverse proxy (default behavior).
- `IMMICH_EXTERNAL_URL`: Optional, only when browser-facing Immich links differ from backend-to-Immich calls.
- `CARTO_API_KEY`: Optional. Free CARTO basemap key. Without it the map works but every tile is stamped "API KEY REQUIRED" — see [CARTO basemap](#carto-basemap).

Example:

```bash
IMMICH_URL=http://immich-server:2283
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
TRUST_PROXY_TLS=true
SYNC_INTERVAL_MS=300000
```

## 2) Run it

### Option A: Docker Compose (recommended)

From the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Option B: Pre-built images

```bash
docker network create immich-places-net

docker run -d --name immich-places-backend --network immich-places-net --env-file .env -v immich-places-data:/data ghcr.io/majorfi/immich-places-backend

docker run -d --name immich-places --network immich-places-net -p 3032:3032 -e PORT=3032 -e BACKEND_URL=http://immich-places-backend:8082 ghcr.io/majorfi/immich-places
```

The frontend command takes its configuration from `-e` flags rather than `.env`. See [CARTO basemap](#carto-basemap) to add a basemap key.

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3032
```

## 3) First run flow (fast path)

1. Register or log in to Immich Places.
2. On first login, provide your Immich API key when prompted.
3. Once the key is accepted, the map view opens automatically.
4. Wait for sync completion, then start correcting assets without GPS.

## Immich API key permissions required

Immich Places validates the key with `GET /api/users/me` and then calls:

- `GET /api/search/metadata` (read assets for sync/search)
- `GET /api/albums` and `GET /api/albums/{id}` (album listing and album contents)
- `GET /api/stacks` (stack synchronization)
- `PUT /api/assets` (bulk write updates when saving coordinates)
- `GET /api/assets/{id}/thumbnail` (asset preview thumbnails)

The following Immich permissions are required:

- `user.read`
- `asset.read`
- `asset.update`
- `asset.view`
- `album.read`
- `library.read` (if External Library is used)
- `stack.read`

## Required environment variables

- `IMMICH_URL` (required): Immich base URL visible from the backend container.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (required): Must be stable across restarts; changing it will make stored keys unreadable.
- `TRUST_PROXY_TLS` (required unless insecure mode): Must match your deployment TLS posture.
- `ALLOW_INSECURE` (optional): Set to `true` only for local non-HTTPS testing.

## Optional environment variables

- `IMMICH_EXTERNAL_URL` (optional): Public Immich URL for link generation/fallback behavior.
- `FRONTEND_PORT` (default `3032`): Frontend port exposed to the host.
- `REGISTRATION_ENABLED` (default `true`): Set to `false` to disable new users.
- `SYNC_INTERVAL_MS` (default `300000`): Background sync frequency in milliseconds.
- `SUGGESTIONS_NEIGHBOR_WINDOW_HOURS` (default `6`): For "Nearby in time" suggestions, how many hours before/after a photo to search for geolocated neighbors. Widen it if your library is geotagged sparsely; narrow it to avoid suggesting a location from a different outing on the same day.
- `DATA_DIR` (default `/data`): Backend DB path inside container.
- `PORT` (default `8082`): Backend listen port inside container.
- `BACKEND_URL` (frontend): Backend service URL used by the Next.js rewrite, default is `http://backend:8082`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE` (frontend): Client API base path, default `/api/backend`.
- `CARTO_API_KEY` (frontend): CARTO basemap API key. Without it the map tiles carry an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark. See [CARTO basemap](#carto-basemap).
- `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`: IANA timezone fallback for GPX import when auto-detection fails (e.g. `Europe/Vienna`).
- `DAWARICH_URL`: URL for Dawarich location history import integration.
- `DAWARICH_SYNC_INTERVAL_MS` (default `86400000`): Dawarich sync frequency in milliseconds (default: 24 hours).
- `DEBUG` (default `false`): Set to `true` to enable verbose HTTP request logging.

## Geocoding providers

Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) is used by default and requires no API key. You can optionally add HERE Maps and/or Google Maps as additional providers to improve geocoding quality.

The provider chain always starts with Nominatim, then tries each configured provider in order. The first provider that returns a strong result wins. If a provider returns a weak result (just coordinates or "Unknown"), the next provider in the chain is tried.

Configure with `GEOCODE_PROVIDER` as a comma-separated list:

| Value                 | Chain                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `nominatim` (default) | Nominatim only              |
| `here`                | Nominatim -> HERE           |
| `google`              | Nominatim -> Google         |
| `here,google`         | Nominatim -> HERE -> Google |

**Provider env vars:**

| Variable           | Purpose                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GEOCODE_PROVIDER` | Comma-separated provider chain (default: `nominatim`)          |
| `HERE_API_KEY`     | API key for HERE Maps geocoding                                |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`   | API key for Google Maps geocoding                              |
| `GEOCODE_API_KEY`  | Legacy fallback key (used if provider-specific key is not set) |
| `GEOCODE_TIMEOUT`  | Upstream geocode request timeout in seconds (default: `10`)    |

**Getting API keys:**

- **HERE Maps**: Sign up at [developer.here.com](https://developer.here.com). Free tier includes 250,000 requests/month.
- **Google Maps**: Enable the [Geocoding API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/geocoding-backend.googleapis.com) in Google Cloud Console. Free tier includes roughly 10,000 requests/month.

## CARTO basemap

The map tiles come from CARTO. Since August 2026 CARTO requires an API key for its raster basemaps and stamps an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark across tiles served without one. The app works without a key — the watermark is the only difference — but a key is free and removes it.

**Getting a key:**

Request one at [carto.com/basemaps/apikey](https://carto.com/basemaps/apikey/). The form asks for your email, the domain the maps will be served from, and a one-line description of the project. No CARTO account is needed and there is no approval queue — the key is emailed back immediately.

The free allowance is 5 million tile requests per calendar month, counted across raster and vector. Past that CARTO gets in touch rather than cutting access off.

**Setting it:**

| Deployment                  | How                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Option A (Docker Compose)   | Add `CARTO_API_KEY=<your-key>` to `.env`, then `docker compose up -d`  |
| Option B (pre-built images) | Add `-e CARTO_API_KEY=<your-key>` to the frontend `docker run` command |

The key belongs to the **frontend** container, not the backend. Unlike `HERE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, which the backend uses for geocoding, this one is used by the browser when it requests tiles. It is read at startup, so recreate the container after changing it.

**Notes:**

- The key is visible in the browser's tile requests. That is inherent to CARTO's raster basemaps, which are keyed client-side. Use a key issued for this instance and do not reuse it across unrelated projects.
- A wrong key looks exactly like no key: CARTO returns the watermarked tile with HTTP 200 and no error. If the watermark persists after setting the variable, check the value before suspecting anything else.
- Keep the CARTO and OpenStreetMap attribution visible on the map. It is on by default and is a condition of the free tier.

## Existing Immich user tips

- For a containerized Immich stack, point `IMMICH_URL` at the Immich service name.
- For remote Immich behind HTTPS, use `https://...` directly in `IMMICH_URL`.
- You can disable registration (`REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false`) once your admin account exists.
- First sync may take longer on large libraries. Check service logs if anything stalls.

## Health and troubleshooting

- Frontend logs: `docker compose logs -f frontend`
- Backend logs: `docker compose logs -f backend`
- If startup fails on `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, confirm `.env` is in the project root and contains the key.
- If the map shows an "API KEY REQUIRED" watermark, set `CARTO_API_KEY` and recreate the frontend container — see [CARTO basemap](#carto-basemap).

Contributor verification commands, pinned toolchains and remaining test infrastructure are documented in the [engineering testing guide](docs/engineering/testing.md#available-commands-and-remaining-setup).

## Security usage note

As with any software, there may still be bugs, edge-case errors, or incomplete hardening details.
We aim to keep behavior safe, stable, and security-aware, but no software is perfect.
We used AI models as a drafting and review aid during implementation.  
It was not vibe-coded. Design decisions major part of the implementation were still done by a human.

Use this project at your own risk.
